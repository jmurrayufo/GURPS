Collection of python scripts to help play GURPS

Installation 
============

So you want to use some of these handy scripts? 

Cool! 

Your going to need to do a BIT of work before you can use it though. 

1) First of all, you will need to install [Python 2.7.4][1] for your OS. IMPORTANT: Do NOT use version 3.3.1+ of python. These scripts are designed to work on 2.7.4.

2) Download the latest version of this repo. You can do this with the ZIP button up top, or by cloning this repo using any Git tool. Downloading the zip file is easier in the short run, but updates will require your being careful of save files. 

3) After you have installed it, you are ready to run the scripts! Using the command prompt is more verbose, but you can doulble click on many of the scripts to use them. "RangedCombat/combatParse.py" is the main ranged combat application.
